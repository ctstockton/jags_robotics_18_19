## Development

### Robot Description

The smaller robot is desired to be mostly autonomous. The Larger robot is desired to be more controlled than autonomous. The smaller robot's focus is on the balls on the field. Its goal is to collect balls and fire them autonomously at the flags. The Larger robot's focus is on the disks and parking. Its goal is to either stash disks, flip disks, set balls on appropriate disks, and battle out the parking bonus.
